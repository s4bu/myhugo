## Attack

An issue was discovered in EMC Data Domain DD OS 5.7 family, versions prior to 5.7.5.6; EMC Data Domain DD OS 6.0 family, versions prior to 6.0.2.9; EMC Data Domain DD OS 6.1 family, versions prior to 6.1.0.21; EMC Data Domain Virtual Edition 2.0 family, all versions; EMC Data Domain Virtual Edition 3.0 family, versions prior to 3.0 SP2 Update 1; and EMC Data Domain Virtual Edition 3.1 family, versions prior to 3.1 Update 2. EMC Data Domain DD OS contains a memory overflow vulnerability in SMBv1 which may potentially be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker. An attacker may completely shut down both the SMB service and active directory authentication. This may also allow remote code injection and execution. *I found this vulnerability exist in the Likewise server which is used by the many commercial products.* 


## POC 

Will update soon.
